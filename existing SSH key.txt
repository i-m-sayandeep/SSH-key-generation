1.You first need to check if there is a SSH key in your GitHub account.
    Rules to check:
        1. You can go to your Github account and under settings serach for SSH and GPG keys and see there if there is key.

            Github account -> settings -> SSH and GPG keys

        2. Delete the exsisting key from there as it mistach with your public and private key to give remote access to your account.


2.Then Open Git Bash. (type Git Bash on search bar of your PC) 

3. On the terminal paste the below code:

     $ ls -al ~/.ssh 

(This will give a directory view of .ssh directory)

4. Check for the  underlies files if the exits:
    id_rsa.pub
    id_ecdsa.pub
    id_ed25519.pub

If they are listed, delete the files from (c/users/(you)/.shh/) as there is mismatch in your private key and public key.
As you have already deleted the key from your github account this is likely to be empty

Now you are all set to create your own SSH password protected key.

(Refer to the ""generate SSH key.txt"" in this repository)
