After clearing the .ssh directory.

Come back to Git Bash terminal

1. Type or paste the below code in the terminal of Git Bash.

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

    (enter your GitHub account email address within quotes)

This will create a private rsa key pair

2. After few seconds a promote will come saying:

    Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/(you)/.ssh/id_rsa):_

Just press enter as this will automatically be set to the default .shh folder in your PC.


3. !! MOST IMPORTANT !!
After the file path a new promote will come :

    Enter passphrase:

if you want your SHH key to be password protected type a password and again it will ask to re-enter for confirmation of password.
else you just type enter to leave the SHH key public.

Note: while typing the passphrase nothing will be shown in the terminal and everytime you push you need to use this passphrase.

Finally Congrats you have created your own SSH key.

Now final steps to add to your agent and account follow the "adding SSH key.txt" in this repository.
